# ReSupertool
Rewrites the supertool.com for sale list newsletter pages to include in-line images.

Currently trying to figure out a solution for caching to not overwhelm Patrick's server.

See supertool mailing list with images:

*NOTE: This project is now deprecated due to the rollout of mixed content bans in browsers. supertool is an old site that uses http, making it impossible to fetch from on github. as well, cors-anywhere has been gimped - introducing further complications in fetching the raw html site.*

# Development
Very simple

* `./dev.sh`
* browse to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
